## Chew Privacy Policy

Last Updated: December 2014

Chew understands that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy applies to any and all services, applications, platforms, websites, or other affiliated ventures offered by Chew. Throughout this Policy, "Chew" and "We" refers to http://chew.tv and its affiliates. "You" or "Users" refers to you, our users, everyone who uses, subscribes to, publishes through, joins, or visits Chew. The "Chew Service" refers to the applications, platform, web site and services controlled, operated or produced by Chew.

By using the Chew Service, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this notice. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Chew Service [Terms of Use](http://chew.tv/guide/terms). Your use of the Chew Service and any personal information you provide through the Chew Service are subject at all times to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.

#### **1.	The Information Chew Collects:**

Information You Provide 

You may provide to Chew what is generally called "personally identifiable" information (such as your name, email address, credit card number, postal mailing address, and telephone numbers) if you use certain services or products from the Chew Service, or otherwise use the features and functionality of the Chew Service.

"Automatically Collected“ Information: When you access the Chew Service (including through your computer or your mobile device) or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology. This “automatically collected“ information may include Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), a unique user ID, version of software installed, system type, the content and pages that you access on the Chew Service, and the dates and times that you visit the Chew Service.

"Cookies“ Information

When you access the Chew Service, we may send one or more cookies (small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters) to your computer. Chew may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Chew Service. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the best way to modify your cookie settings.

"Pixel Tags“ or “Clear Gifs“ 

A pixel tag, also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our Chew Service but not on your computer. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page. If you turn off cookies the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.

Your User ID

Your User ID is displayed throughout the Chew Service and is therefore available to the public. Therefore, if you associate your actual name with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your activities on the Chew Service.

#### **2.	The Way Chew Uses Information:**

Chew uses the information that you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the Chew Service - as well as to track user-generated content and users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other applicable laws.

We may use your email address or mobile number, without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of Chew Service updates, for customer service purposes, and to send privacy or security related notices.

Chew uses all of the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve the way the Chew Service works and looks and to create new features and functionality.

Chew may use automatically collected information and cookie information to: (a) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the Chew Service; (b) provide customised third-party advertisements, content and information; (c) monitor and report on the effectiveness of third-party marketing campaigns; (d) monitor and report aggregate usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.

#### **3. When Chew Discloses Information:**

Chew does not share your personally identifiable information with other organisations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent. Please be aware, however, that any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on any publicly available portion of the Chew Service - such as when you publish your public profile information - becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction.

Chew may disclose automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, referring/ exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to assist those parties in understanding the usage and demographic patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, or other functionality on the Chew Service.

We may disclose some limited user information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to: provide website hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist Chew in improving the Chew Service and creating new services features. We contractually require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, we authorise only a limited use of such information, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures.

Chew may disclose user information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with laws (i.e. U.K. copyright or trademark law) or respond to a court order, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity.

Chew also reserves the right to disclose user information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; enforce our [Terms of Use](http://chew.tv/guide/terms); protect Chew from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Chew Service; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Chew, our Users, or others.

#### **4. Your Choices and Access to your Personal Information**

You may, of course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information with Chew, in which case Chew will not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the Chew Service. You may view, update, correct, or delete your user information and preferences by contacting us at [support@chew.tv](mailto:support@chew.tv).

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information. You, as a user of the Chew Service, are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique user password and account information at all times.

#### **5. Advertisers**

Chew allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Chew Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements that appear within the Chew Service and they automatically receive your IP Address and other log file information when this happens. Such third-party ad servers may also use other technologies (such as cookies, javascript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalise their advertising content.

Chew does not provide your personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Chew to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. Chew reserves the right the add or remove third-party ad networks or ad servers in its discretion and Chew may not at all times list such updated ad network or ad server partners in this Privacy Policy.

#### **6. Our Commitment to Data Security:**

Chew uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Chew, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Chew makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

If Chew learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Chew may post a notice on the Chew Service if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us at [support@chew.tv](mailto:support@chew.tv).

#### **7. Our Commitment to Children's Privacy:**

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Chew does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age. If Chew learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on or through the Chew Service, then Chew will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.

If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a Chew Service member, then please contact Chew at [support@chew.tv](mailto:support@chew.tv) to have that child's account terminated and information deleted.

#### **8. International Visitors:**

For users visiting the Chew Service from outside the European Union, please note that any data you enter into the Chew Service will be transferred into the European Union for use by Chew and its affiliates for any of the purposes described herein. In addition, because Chew operates globally, we may make information we gather available to worldwide business units and affiliates. By providing any data on the Chew Service, you hereby expressly consent to such transfers of your data to the United Kingdom or other countries.

#### **9. In the Event of Merger or Sale:**

In the event that Chew is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.

#### **10. Third Parties**

Except as otherwise expressly provided otherwise, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you or that you disclose to us. If you disclose your information to others besides Chew, whether they are users of the Chew Service or on other sites or services, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Chew does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

#### **11. Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy:**

This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically without further notice to you and this will be reflected by the "LAST UPDATED" date found at the top of this page. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. In general, we only use your personal information in the manner described in the Privacy Policy in effect when we received that personal information. Your continued use of the Chew Service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any future revisions.

For revisions to this Privacy Policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of personal information you have provided to us, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you and obtain your consent before implementing revisions with respect to such information.
