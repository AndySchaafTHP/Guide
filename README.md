# Chew Guide to Live Streaming

## About Chew

With the Chew platform, you can start live stream an event in minutes. You can use your smartphone, computer or even a professional broadcasting setup.

## About the Chew Guide

The Chew Guide will help you get started on the Chew platform - as well as helping you create your first event, choose your streaming kit and set up an encoder. To make things easier, everything in the Guide is split into 4 categories. You can read up on as little or as much as you need to get started on Chew!

## Open Source

There are lots of sources of information on live streaming out there online. In most cases though it comes with some biases based on the platform. At Chew we've been live streaming events for years and think it's time to start sharing that knowledge online without limitations on the platform. With the exeption of pages that discribe Chew platform and API itself feel free to submit issues and pull requests for review!
