There's a tonne of information available online to learn about live streaming. 

In some cases, we've found this information isn't always correct or as useful as it could be. We've been streaming events for a good few years and think it's time to start sharing the knowledge we've gained - without limitations or bias. 

With the exception of pages that describe the [Chew platform](http://chew.tv/guide/using_chew/getting_started), feel free to submit issues and pull requests for review!
