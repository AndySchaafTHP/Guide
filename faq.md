# Frequently Asked Questions

Live streaming can be overwelming at first. We've fielded a lot of questions through our time helping to run hundreds of successful live events. If you have any direct questions (or queries relating to below) then please feel free to [get in touch](http://chew.tv/guide/help_and_support)!

## What is live streaming?

Live streaming is the broadcast  of live video and audio coverage of (an event) over the Internet.

## Why should I live stream my event?

Live streaming is an extremely cost effective way of taking a local event and giving it a global audience. Or at least that's how we see it!

## Can I watch Chew streams on a mobile device?

Chew is built to work with any up-to-date browser, on any device, anywhere. You can watch streams on desktop devices (with our Flash-based player) or on mobile devices (using our mobile-friendly player).

Please keep your browser and software updated to the latest version for the smoothest viewing experience! 

## Can I offer pay-per-view streams using Chew?

Yes, but this is currently a private Alpha feature. Please [get in touch](http://chew.tv/guide/support) to find out more.

## Does Chew limit the number of viewers who can watch my streams?

No, the only thing we limit about our users' streams is the event duration. The platform is built to handle large volumes of traffic so do your worst and let's see who can set/ break the viewcount record!

## Do I need to worry about copyright issues?

Chew is unlike other live streaming platforms, as we're built with rightsholders and copyright owners in mind. We are rights compliant and licensed to the fullest extent possible within the markets we operate in. 

We do, however, take a very dim view of users going out of their way to violate applicable laws. Chew  will terminate any account found to be actively breaching content copyrights.

## How many cameras should I use for my stream?

Obviously for a video stream, you'll need at least one camera. If you want to, you can broadcast an audio-only stream through the Chew platform. Be inventive! 

The number of cameras you can stream from is limited by the encoder you're using, your computer's processing power and your hardware.

## What encoder should I use?

Chew is built to work with most encoders available on the market. We cater to users with free encoders like Flash Media Live Encoder, through to users with professional broadcast-level Wirecast licenses. 

If you come across any issues connecting an encoder to the Chew platform, please [get in touch](http://chew.tv/guide/help_and_support)!

## What type of connection should I use to stream?

While Wifi is often as fast as a wired connection, wired is much more reliable. If you're running your stream from a hardware or software encoder, we've found it best to setup equipment near an ethernet port or router. We also recommend testing the connection strength before you start setting up; using a tool like [Speedtest.net](http://speedtest.net/).

On mobile, Wifi is recommended over 3G. However, if you have a 4G-enabled phone and strong, consistent signal then 4G may be better than using a shared Wifi connection. Again, check the signal strength in good time, perhaps using the [Speedtest.net app](http://www.speedtest.net/mobile/).
