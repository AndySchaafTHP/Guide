# Stream forwarding

Chew [crews](https://chew.tv/guide/using_chew/crews) are a great way for groups of DJs to stream together or back to back. 
With more DJs broadcasting and more viewers watching shows on Chew, we want to make it as simple as possible to keep the party going. 

Our stream forwarding feature allows crew members to forward viewers onto a new show once one has finished. 

Here's how it works:

1. Create a [new show](https://chew.tv/account/show/new)
2. Add the new show to a [crew you're a member of](https://chew.tv/account#crews) by tagging it with the crew tag
3. Go Live as you would normally and play your finest tunes for everyone to enjoy
4. The DJ you want to forward your viewers onto needs to either schedule their show to start when yours ends or be live when you want to end your broadcast
5. When you're finished your show, click 'Stop Show' on Chew to end your broadcast
6. Your viewers will be redirected to the next scheduled show inside the crew or the next live show (if one has already started)!
