# Embedding the Chew Player

#### ** Only available for Pro accounts **

If you have a website or blog and want to embed the Chew player into it, we've made the process super simple for you. You'll find your Show's unique embed code on the Run page. From there, simply copy and paste the iframe embed code into the HTML view of your CMS or into your website's site code. If you don't manage your website directly yourself, then your content editor or website administrator will be able to do this for you.

## Embedding Over SSL/HTTPS

**We currently don't support SSL/HTTPS connections by default on all accounts.** If you attempt to embed a Chew player on an https page you may find the player is blank.

To enable SSL on your account, please contact [Chew Support](mailto:support@chew.tv).

## Responsive Embedding

The Chew player embed code is  fully responsive. When you copy the embed code, you will see that it includes some CSS which keeps the player at the correct dimensions - regardless of the width of your page.

_You can also try sharing the Chew watch page. It's  responsive and supports both desktop and mobile devices._
