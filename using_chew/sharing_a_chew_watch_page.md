# Sharing the Watch page

Once you've created an Event on the Chew platform, you'll need to publicise your Watch page so your viewers can access the broadcast.

If you're a Free or Pro user, the Watch page is the only place viewers can access your broadcasts. 

If you're a Studio or Tour user, you have the ability to embed the Chew player on external sites (i.e. separate to the Chew platform) - while retaining the ability to use the Watch page if you so wish.

The Watch page is unique to each of your events, and can be accessed via its own unique URL. It looks like this: **http://watch.chew.tv/youraccountname/your-event-title**

You can access the Watch page's unique URL from the Share section of your Event's Run page, along with the embed code (if applicable to your account).
