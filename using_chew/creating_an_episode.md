# Episodes page

Once you've successfully logged into your Chew account, you'll land on your [Episodes](http://chew.tv/account/episodes) page. This is your account homepage and it acts as an archive for your Episodes broadcast through Chew. 

From the Episodes page, you'll be able to access the following via the links in the header: 

- Account settings
	- Where you can up or downgrade your account depending on the duration of your streamed Episodes
- New Episode page
	- Where you can create a new Episode
- Episodes page
- Logout.  

# New Episode

The New Episode page allows you to create a new Chew stream. 

Give your episode a name (or title) and set a start time. You'll also need to set the stream duration - but if your duration is over the time limit set by your account, you'll need to upgrade before being able to create your new Episode. 

Then you'll need to upload a flyer image (make sure it's a .PNG and under 10MB file size). The flyer image acts as a cover photo on both your Watch page and Chew player (before your Episode starts).

Choose the location of your Episode (i.e. where you're actually streaming from) so we know which servers to use - this helps avoid server and player lag and during your Episode.

Finally, give your episode a description so your viewers know what the episode is. This description is used on the Watch page and in the default share text viewers see when your Watch link is shared. 

# Run page

The Run page is private to you and provides the Episode's unique stream information. 

From the Run page, you can view your Episode's Chew player (where the stream will display), the unique Encoder settings (including Server URL and Stream name) and the Watch page URL. You are also able to engage with your viewers in the Chew Chat box without leaving the Episode's Run page. 

If you have a Studio or Tour account, your Episode embed code will also be displayed on the Run page (external player embedding is disabled on Free and Pro accounts). 

# Watch Page

The public Watch page is where your viewers watch and engage with your broadcast. 

You'll need to publicise the Watch page URL (which is displayed on your Episode's Run page). Once your viewers have accessed the Watch page they can view your Episode through the Chew player, engage with you and other viewers in the Chew Chat and share the Watch page themselves via the social share functionality.
