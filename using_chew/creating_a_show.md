# Shows page

Once you've successfully logged into your Chew account, you'll land on your [Shows](http://chew.tv/account/shows) page. This is your account homepage and it acts as an archive for your Shows broadcast through Chew. 

From the Shows page, you'll be able to access the following via the links in the header: 

- Account settings
	- Where you can update your account details
- Go Live
	- Where you create a new Show
- Shows page
- Logout.  

# Go Live

If you've clicked on the 'Go Live' or 'New Show' links, Chew will create a new Show for you. The Run page is private to you and gives you each Show's unique stream information. 

Once you've allowed camera and microphone permissions, you're ready to Go Live and start streaming! 

-	You can, if you want to, give your Show a name (or title) and set a start time if you're creating a future Show. If your Show is created for a date in the future, the Chew player will display a countdown timer.
- You can also upload a flyer image. The flyer image acts as a cover photo on both your Watch page and Chew player (before your Show starts). If you don't upload a flyer image, Chew will use to the platform default. 
- Lastly, you can give your Show a description. This description, if you use one, is used on the Watch page and in the default share text people see when your Watch link is shared. 

From the Run page, you can view your Show's player (where you can preview what your viewers will see) and the Watch page URL. You are also able to engage with your viewers in the Chew Chat box without leaving the Show's Run page. 

# Watch Page

The public Watch page is where your viewers watch and engage with your stream. 

You'll need to publicise the Watch page URL (which is displayed on your Show's Run page). Once your viewers have accessed the Watch page, they can view your Show through the Chew player, engage with you and other viewers in the Chew Chat and share the Watch page themselves via the social share functionality.
