# Sharing the Watch page

Once you've created a Show on Chew, you'll need to publicise the Show's Watch page. This will allow your viewers to view your stream.

If you have a Chew Producer account, the Watch page is the only place viewers can access your broadcasts. 

If you have a Chew Pro account, you have the ability to embed the Chew player on external sites (i.e. separate to the Chew platform) - while retaining the ability to use the Watch page if you so wish.

The Watch page is unique to each of your events, and can be accessed via its own unique URL. It looks like this: **http://chew.tv/youraccountname/your-event-title**

You can access the Watch page's unique URL from your Show's Run page, along with the embed code (if applicable to your account).
