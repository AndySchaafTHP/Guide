# Embedding the Chew Show Player

If you want to embed the Chew player on an external site, we've made the process super simple for you. You'll find your Show's unique embed code on the Run page. From there, simply copy and paste the iframe embed code into the HTML view of your CMS or into your website's code. If you don't manage your website directly yourself, then your content editor or website administrator will be able to do this for you.

## Embedding the Chew Channel Player

If you'd rather embed a single player, instead of updating your embed for every Show, you can. We've created a Channel-level embed code (which is at the bottom of your [Account page](http://chew.tv/account)) which will display every live Show (or scheduled Show) on your Chew account. Embed the Channel Player as you would with the Show Player (or any other embed)!

## Embedding Over SSL/HTTPS

**We currently don't support SSL/HTTPS connections by default.** If you attempt to embed a Chew player on a https page you may find the player is blank.

To enable SSL on your account, please contact [Chew Support](mailto:support@chew.tv).

## Responsive Embedding

The Chew player embed code is fully responsive. When you copy the embed code, you will see that it includes some CSS which keeps the player at the correct dimensions - regardless of the width of your page.

_You can also try sharing the Chew watch page. It's responsive and supports both desktop and mobile devices._
