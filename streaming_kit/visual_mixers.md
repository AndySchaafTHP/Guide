# Visual Mixers

A visual mixer takes the signal from multiple cameras and allows you to control which shot is displayed to an output signal like an encoder. All visual mixers will allow you at least simple transitions like fade or wipe between different shots. Often, they will include more advanced features like playing back previously recorded video or showing images or graphics.
