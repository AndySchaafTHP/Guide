## LED Light Panels

We swear by using LED light panels to light our events. They're inexpensive, don't take up too much space or consume too much power. And they're bright! 

Depending on the [event setup](http://chew.tv/guide/event_setup/getting_started), we suggest you use one or more LED light panels. You can also use filters to really get that specific shot you're aiming for.

 - Natural light filters make skin tones more natural for interviews
 - Often red light works in dark venues as it won't effect the performer's vision.
