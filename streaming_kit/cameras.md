# Cameras

Choosing the camera(s) you're going to use is one of the most important decisions to make. Almost anyone can now afford to buy full HD cameras - they're that inexpensive. The main difference in ability will be how the camera reacts in low light performances (Key for events in [Bars or Clubs](/r/event_setup/bar_and_club_events)) or its ability to capture fast motion (such as [Arts and Performance Events](/r/event_setup/arts_and_performance_events)). In this section, we try to cover a few good cameras across a range of prices.

## Terms

 - HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) - video output port often on consumer cameras
 - SDI (Serial digital interface) - often found on professional grade cameras.

## HDMI/SDI Output

Live video is very different to recording to disk. For the live video signal to reach the encoder, the camera you buy **must support live video output**. On consumer cameras, this often means they will have a mini or micro HDMI output.

## Low Light Performance

If you're filming dark events in [bars or clubs](http://chew.tv/guide/event_setup/bar_and_club_events), you'll need to make sure the camera is up to the job. Usually cameras with larger sensors are better suited to low light - because there is a larger surface area on the sensor meaning the camera is able to capture what light is available.

The best way to test low light performance is to try your camera in a dimly lit room. Watch the recording back - poor low light performance will show up as graininess in the black areas of the image, as well as a lack of clarity or detail in the image.

## Fast Motion

For [performance events](http://chew.tv/guide/event_setup/arts_and_performance_events), the most important thing is often being able to capture the performer's movement. In this use case, the desired quality of the camera is its motion capture ability.

To demo this feature in-store or while testing a camera, see how much the image distorts while quickly panning the shot.
