## HDMI vs SDI and Converters

When deciding between HDMI and SDI connectors for you cameras, it's important to note the key difference in the connectors (other than durability) is the fact that HDMI signal can only run a short distance (often less than 10m). Signal over SDI runs much longer. 

If you use more affordable camera equipment that *only* supports HDMI, you may want to look at buying an HDMI to SDI converter to run cable over longer distances.
