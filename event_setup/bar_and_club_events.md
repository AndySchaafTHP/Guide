# Bar or Club Events

As with any event where you're filming or recording the audio, getting the event setup right is key. 

In our time of running production on live streams, we've collated a top tips list of things you might want to consider when creating your own event.

## Cameras

Depending on the number of cameras at your disposal, you'll want to figure out what's the most important shot in your stream. 

With one camera, in a club environment for example, you could frame the performer square in shot. You could also frame the crowd in shot, giving viewers the best visual in-stream experience possible.

With two cameras, you could have a shot of the performer and a shot of the crowd to give your stream the feel of actually being at the event in person. 

With more than two cameras well, you can frame whatever you want! Just remember to get everything level, in shot and in focus.

Remember performers are likely to move about so make sure you can cover them if, for example, they decide to remove a microphone from its stand and walk about.

## Lighting

Depending on your location, trying to get the best lighting for your stream is key. Too bright or dark and no one will be able to see a thing! 

- Ambient lighting is absolutely fine as long as you can see what's going on in the shot. Check the stream preview on the Run page - use your judgement! 
 - If you do need to use backup lighting, try to avoid shining light directly into your camera shots. You'll blind your viewers and the camera won't be able to focus.
 - If you can, place any lights behind the camera (i.e. illuminating the camera's view) or to the side of what you're framing for the best shot.
 - Bear in mind that lighting may change throughout the night and dependant on the act playing.

## Sound

If you're streaming an event where there's a mixer, you'll need to add the master mixer output as an input source to your encoder. 

If you're streaming the audio from your cameras, you won't need to add an audio-specific source to your encoders. 

Things to check with your stream's sound:

- You'll need to keep an eye on audio levels throughout your stream to avoid peaks or troughs 
- If the volume is too loud or too quiet your viewers will have an uncomfortable listening experience!
