## Arts and Performance Events

As with any event where you're filming or recording the audio, getting the event setup right is key. 

In our time of running production on live streams, we've collated a top tips list of things you might want to consider when creating your own event.

## Cameras

Depending on the number of cameras at your disposal, you'll want to figure out what's the most important shot in your stream. 

With one camera, you could frame the performers square in shot. You could also frame the crowd in shot, giving viewers the best visual in-stream experience possible.

With two cameras, you could have a shot of the performers and a shot of the crowd to give your stream the feel of actually being at the event in person. 

With more than two cameras, well, you can frame whatever you want! Just remember to get everything level, in shot and in focus.

You most likely want a moving camera to track the artist or lead actors performance.

## Lighting

For most stage events, lighting shouldn't be a problem. If strong spotlights are used, make sure your camera's white balance is adjusted so the shot doesn't become too light - you want to avoid white outs!

## Sound

If you're streaming an event where there's a mixer, you'll need to add the master mixer output as an input source to your encoder. 

If you're streaming the audio from your cameras, you won't need to add an audio-specific source to your encoders. 

Things to check with your stream's sound:

- You'll need to keep an eye on audio levels throughout your stream to avoid peaks or troughs 
- If the volume is too loud or too quiet your viewers will have an uncomfortable listening experience!
