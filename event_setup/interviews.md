# Interviews

As with any event where you're filming or recording the audio, getting the event setup right is key. 

In our time of running production on live streams, we've collated a top tips list of things you might want to consider when creating your own event.

## Cameras

Depending on the number of cameras at your disposal, you'll want to figure out what's the most important shot in your stream. 

With one camera, in an interview environment for example, you could frame the interviewee square in shot. You could also frame both interviewer and interviewee in shot, giving viewers the best visual in-stream experience possible.

With two cameras, you could have separate shots of the interviewer and interviewee that you mix together live during the broadcast; giving your stream a bit more of a depth.

With more than two cameras, well, you can frame whatever you want! Just remember to get everything level, in shot and in focus.

## Lighting

For and interview, lighting is key and you have so much more control here than something like a [Bar or Club Event](http://chew.tv/guide/event_setup/bar_and_club_events).

Lighting is an art in itself. The key to good lighting is to have one main light and another fill light on the interview subject, plus an additional light to highlight the background and give the shot depth.

## Sound

If you're streaming an event where there's a mixer, you'll need to add the master mixer output as an input source to your encoder. 

If you're streaming the audio from your cameras, you won't need to add an audio-specific source to your encoders. 

We'd recommend you use something like a [Lavalier microphone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavalier_microphone) for your interview subject as this will capture the cleanest sound. Otherwise a highly directional mic comes in handy!

Things to check with your stream's sound:

- You'll need to keep an eye on audio levels throughout your stream to avoid peaks or troughs 
- If the volume is too loud or too quiet your viewers will have an uncomfortable listening experience!
