# Encoder Setup

_**Please note the Chew platform does not yet support the use of external cameras or non-USB audio sources**_

Once you have planned your Show and you've chosen your broadcast kit, the final step to streaming your first Show is your encoder. The encoder takes the live video and audio from your cameras and sends it to your broadcast servers, where your viewers can then interact with it live.

Chew currently removes the need to use an encoder - with seamless browser-based streaming using your computer's webcam and microphone (or USB audio interface).

You can buy dedicated hardware encoders or use a computer, laptop or even [*Chew Go Live*](http://chew.tv/guide/encoder_setup/chew_mobile_app) (our smartphone broadcast app), to live stream.

## Terms

 - Streaming - The broadcast of live video and audio (of an event) over the Internet

 - Encoder - A piece of software (or hardware) that encodes raw video and audio into broadcastable live footage and sends it to the Chew servers.
 
## Streaming Formats

Regardless of the encoder you're using make sure video and audio are streamed in the following format:

**Video should be streamed in H.264 regardless of what encoder you're streaming from.**
**Video should have a framerate of 30fps or less.**

**Audio should be streamed in AAC.**

## Software Encoders

If you're using one of the common (free or paid) encoders, we'll try to cover how to set them up right here.

## Hardware Encoders

Larger live setups often use dedicated hardware encoders rather that software. While a software encoder runs on an off-the-shelf computer, a hardware encoder is a dedicated device that handles the video capture encoding and broadcast to the server on its own.
