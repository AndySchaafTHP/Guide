#Setting your bitrates

When live streaming, you need to make sure you're broadcasting audio and video content within the limits of your connection (more specifically, its upload capacity). 

As a rule of thumb, you always want to be broadcasting a video bitrate and audio bitrate 20% lower than your upload speed. To find your upload speed, go to [Speedtest.net](http://speedtest.net) and run a speed test. Once you have your upload speed, you can then calculate the correct video and audio bitrates you'll need to use in your encoder. 

For example, if you have an upload speed of 1MBPS, you want to broadcast combined video and audio bitrates of about 800k (i.e. an audio bitrate of 192k and video of around 600k).

In OBS, if you're using the 'Simple' Output mode in Settings you can update video and audio bitrates in the same section:

If you're using the 'Advanced' Output mode in Settings, you'll need to update video and audio bitrates in their corresponding tabs:
