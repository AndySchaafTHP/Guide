# Doing more with OBS

OBS is a truly versatile piece of software. If you've mastered the single camera stream using OBS, here are a few suggestions of what else you can do to make your Shows on Chew a bit more exciting...

##Multi-cam 

We think the first step in doing more with OBS is adding a second camera to your broadcast. 

If you're using USB webcams as your main video input; this is as simple as adding an extra webcam to OBS when you [get started](http://chew.tv/guide/encoder_setup/open_broadcast_software). 

If you're using external cameras with video capture cards, you can either add a USB camera to your setup (which is often what we do) or, if you're able to, adding a second camera and capture card. 

A second camera gives your audience the ability to see more of what you're doing during the Show, adding that little bit extra to make your content more engaging for viewers. 

##Image overlay

Adding imagery to your OBS broadcast can be as simple as adding a logo to your streams. But you can also add live visualisations, camera templates and more to make your content more visually engaging for your audience. 

We love what [BBC Radio 1xtra's Jamz Supernova](http://chew.tv/futurebounce) does with her shows: multi-cam, image overlays and more. 
[SSR London](https://chew.tv/ssr-london) are another great example of a Chew broadcaster pushing the boundaries of what you can do during a live show. 

##And much, much more
