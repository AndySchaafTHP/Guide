# Chew Developer API

Chew's live streaming technology can be implemented as the core of any website or app. From a pay per view ticketing system, to a brand's mobile live experience. We like to think the opportunities are endless!

To enable quick and easy access to Chew data, our Developer API gives you the ability to access to our features and data.

## Versions
