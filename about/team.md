# The Team

## Ben Bowler

Ben’s music and technology career began early. A drummer since the age of six, he studied technology at school. Ben left college to freelance and run his own e-learning business. But his interest in electronic music and DJing grew, and he came to London to get experience via internships.

He started at a company called [AEI Media](http://aeimedia.co.uk) as a marketing intern and went from there to become a key member of the team, building their live streaming and e-commerce platform. From AEI, Ben moved to [Vice](http://vice.com) to work on their ad sales and internal business apps.

The idea that would become Chew came out of Ben's time at AEI; live streaming was a critical way of pushing new content and promoting AEI's releases to a global audience.

Meeting Chew co-founder Wil Benton was a turning point. Ben had been introduced to Wil the year before and loved his writing style and approach to life on his blog FatKidOnFire. The duo started what was then a sideline project - a project that turned into something more.

With the help of a start-up loan, Chew officially came into being at the start of 2014. The core of a live streaming platform was there, but Wil and Ben lacked focus. Towards the of the year, Chew cost clients as much as £500 per month to use the platform, but the duo had become more of a production company than a platform.

At the end of 2014, Chew was accepted into the [Ignite](http://ignite100.com) accelerator program, which helped Ben and Wil re-focus and re-build the platform into what it is now. Since then, Chew has seen a rapid increase in the number of DJs and music fans coming into the community.

Wil moved to London to study Pharmacology at King's College London in 2007. It was there that he started [FatKidOnFire](http://fatkidonfire.com), which earned him the 'Digital Journalist of the Year' title at the 2010 Guardian Student Media Awards. FKOF is now a chart-topping record label, events brand and an award-winning digital publication. 

Having been introduced by a mutual friend, Wil started working with Ben Bowler in 2013. The duo went on to start Chew in early 2014. After finishing the Ignite accelerator programme, Wil and Ben launched the platform in early 2015. To date, they've raised a seed investment round, welcomed nearly 20,000 users to Chew and hired their first employee. 

Wil is known for his rather unnecessary trainer collection, and enjoys the odd burger, burrito and whiskey while listening to music that frightens his mother. He's also a record label manager and sometimes amateur DJ.

Sam is a 22 year-old computer science graduate with a love for web-development and associated technologies. His interests span the entire stack, from Linux sysadmin to user experience design.

His love for engineering began in 2006 when he registered his first domain for a PHP-based personal website. Since then, Sam's shifted to technologies like AngularJS, Django, Rails, jQuery in conjunction with Linux, SQL, nginx stacks.

As a full-stack developer, Sam's interested in the latest technologies - incorporating them into his projects wherever possible.

Sam joined the Chew team straight out of University (where he graduated with a MEng Computer Science degree within ECS at the University of Southampton), moving to London in the summer of 2015. He's been instrumental in the platform's successes since. Sam spends much of his spare time discovering and exploring (mostly electronic) music. He's a keen DJ and is also experimenting with Logic Pro X in the hope of producing his own music someday soon.
