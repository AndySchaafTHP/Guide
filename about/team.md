# The Team

## Ben Bowler

Ben Bowler’s music and technology career began early. A drummer since the age of six, he also studied technology at school. He left college to freelance and run an e-learning start-up. But his interest in electronic music and DJing grew, and he came to London to get experience via internships.

“I started at a company called AEI Media as a marketing intern and went from there to become a key member of the team, building their live streaming and e-commerce platform,” he explained. “From there I moved to Vice to work on their ad sales and internal business apps – and enjoy the pub they own in Shoreditch!”

Bowler says the seed that became Chew came out of working for AEI. “Live streaming was a critical way of pushing new content and promoting releases to a global audience,” he said.

Meeting Chew co-founder Wil Benton was, Bowler, said, a turning point. “I’d been introduced to Wil the year before and loved his writing style and approach to life from his blog FatKidOnFire,” he said. “After working on a small project together, we started on what was then a sideline project that turned into something more.”

With the help of a start-up loan, Chew officially came into being at the start of 2014. “We had the core of a live-streaming platform for music, but we lacked focus,” said Bowler. “By the end of the year we were charging as much as £500 per month to use the platform, but we’d become more of a production company than a platform.”
At the end of 2014 Chew was accepted into the Ignite accelerator program, which helped them re-focus and re-build the platform into what it is now. Since then, Chew has seen a rapid increase in the number of DJs and music fans coming into the community.

## Wil Benton

Wil moved to London to study Pharmacology at King's College London in 2007. It was there that he started FatKidOnFire, which earned him the 'Digital Journalist of the Year' title at the 2010 Guardian Student Media Awards. FKOF is now a chart-topping record label, events brand and an award-winning digital publication. 

Wil co-founded Chew (an Ignite company) with Ben Bowler in early 2014. After finishing the Ignite accelerator programme, the duo launched the platform in early 2015. To date, they've raised a seed investment round, welcomed nearly 20,000 users to Chew and hired their first employee. 

Wil spends too much money on Nike products, enjoys burgers, burritos and gin (and the odd calzone) while listening to music that frightens his mother.
